                        Elizabeth Woolridge Grant known as Lana Del Rey, born June 21, 1985, is an American singer-songwriter. 
                        Her music is noted for its cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance,
                        glamour, and melancholia, containing references to contemporary pop culture, as well as 1950s and 1960s Americana.

                        Lana Del Rey envisioned a Southern California dream world constructed out of sad girls and bad boys, 
                        manufactured melancholy, and genuine glamour, and then she came to embody this fantasy. At first, her stylized 
                        noir-pop garnered skeptical sneers - the rise of her 2012 debut, Born to Die, was impeded by a tentative live debut 
                        on Saturday Night Live - but Del Rey proved to be tougher than her soft exterior suggested. Following a hit remix of 
                        her single "Summertime Sadness," she steadily gained not only popularity but respect; her second album, 
                        2014's Ultraviolence, received positive reviews to accompany her sales, and her imitators (of which there were many) 
                        became merely an alluring accessory. With subsequent albums like 2020's Grammy-nominated Norman Fucking Rockwell, Del 
                        Rey grew more and more into ideal she intended to be: a damaged torch singer designed as the tragic romantic icon for her age.
